A Pure HTML Website Without CSS and Javascript [Responsive]
#NoCSSChallenge

_________________________________

So, my teacher give an assignment to create a website without using css nor javascript, just HTML. It's a static website obviusly.

So I made it with a hell of table in a table.
I really missing CSS features to margin and padding.
It was terrible if you see the code, but the result was nice.
Suprisingly it was responsive.
Hopefully you like it.

I dare you to create a web with a pure HTML without using CSS, Javascript, PHP nor Frameworks.
Can you?
